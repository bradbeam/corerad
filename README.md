CoreRAD is an extensible and observable IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol router
advertisement daemon.

Apache 2.0 Licensed.

## Overview

CoreRAD is currently an **alpha** project, and will remain as such for the
entirety of the v0.1.x tag series. CoreRAD is currently deployed and running on
several home LAN networks. Early adopters are welcome to join us in
[Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org) in the `#corerad`
channel!

Although the project is now stable enough that it's used to run the author's
IPv6 at home, at this time, no guarantees are made about the project's stability
or reliability.

CoreRAD is inspired by the [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) and
[CoreDHCP](https://coredhcp.io/) projects.
