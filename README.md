CoreRAD is an extensible and observable IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol router
advertisement daemon.

Apache 2.0 Licensed.

## Overview

CoreRAD is currently a **beta** project, and will remain as such for the
entirety of the v0.2.x tag series. CoreRAD is currently deployed and running on
several home LAN networks. Early adopters are welcome to join us in
[Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org) in the `#corerad`
channel!

CoreRAD is inspired by the [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) and
[CoreDHCP](https://coredhcp.io/) projects.
